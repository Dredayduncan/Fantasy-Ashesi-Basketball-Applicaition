# Fantasy-Ashesi-Basketball-Application

Do you know Fantasy Premier League? That is great! If you do not, Fantasy Premier

League (FPL) is an extension of the Premier league app which allows the user to stay in touch

with his favorite team in terms of statistics, transfers, fixtures, results, etc. FPL enables the user

to pick his best 16 players into his team. These players belong to the Barclays Premier League

and are analyzed on the gameplay and awarded points within FPL. Therefore, the better a player

plays, the higher his points in the game. These points are then tallied to a total score which is then compared to that of other users in a particular region as a competition.

Why am I talking about FPL? Because I present to you, Fantasy Ashesi Basketball

Association. A program that allows a user to do similar, but with the Ashesi Basketball

Association. A user will be able to select his team and based on their performance in the league

during the semester; the players are awarded points which are then tallied to an overall score.

For now, the program uses a GUI (Graphical User Interface), Tkinter, to show a welcome

screen on startup with a button that takes the user to another GUI which reads the ABA's data

from their online database and displays it. The user is then required to select 12 players from

this window with careful evaluation using the statistics provided and click the button "next."

When the button is clicked, the selected players are then projected in the next window (GUI)

in a player card on basketball court form which displays the points accumulated by the player and the overall tally at the top.

When the player representations are clicked, the player name, stats, image, and team

are displayed in another GUI to provide a status report on the player. This display also gathers

the information from the online database. Therefore, this program requires an internet

connection to function. The welcome screen is produced from the welcomescreen function, the

selection required all players window is from the AllPlayers class, and the player on court representation window from the FABA class.
